There are no changes required for the source project. However you must make a few changes to your deployment repository. To do this, simply run these commands (change email and URL accordingly):

echo True > enable_https
echo admin@yoursite.com > admin_email
echo https://yoursite.com/ > config/common/route
git add admin_email config/common/route && git commit -m "Upgrade obelisk [https support]"
ob deploy push
